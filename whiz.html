    <h1 class="mt-5">Whiz Methodology (Working Title)</h1>
    
    <h2 class="mt-5">What is it?</h2>
    <p>The Whiz Methodology is the combination of the Proficency-Based Learning theory and Scrum product management framework. At its core, students pick the pace at which they learn the concepts, only moving onto a new concept after gaining proficency on the previous concept. Students work as a team, using a modified Scrum framework to maximize the speed and efficency of learning.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Pillars</h2>

    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="my-5" src="pillars.png"><br>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Five pillars listed above were selected due to their critical need in the classroom. A student missing even one of these pillars will not be successful. The primary objective of the Whiz Methodology is to provide and strengthen each pillar for every student. While the framework is designed to implicitly support the pillars it is the ultimate responsibility of all parties involved in the use of Whiz to ensuse each students' pillars remain intact</p>

        <strong>Sprint </strong>
        <p>A two week time block in which a small subsection of topics are selected with the goal of proficency</p>
        
        <strong>Sprint Planning </strong>
        <p>All the students will coordinate on a "game plan" for the next spring. This will be done in three steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Each student will make a goal for the sprint, determining what topics they want to gain proficency of this sprint</li>
            <li>The students will share their goals with the class</li>
            <li>The group will schedule the demos, group study sessions, etc. that they need to ensure every student accomplishes their goal</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Standup </strong>
        <p>A 15 minute meeting where each student shares the answer to three questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did I work on yesterday</li>
            <li>What am I working on today</li>
            <li>What blockers do I have</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students can plan to meet up after Standup to work together to overcome blockers. The goal of the meeting react to coordinate with classmates in order to continue to make progress towards the Sprint Goal.</p>
        
        <strong>Retrospective </strong>
        <p>Here the team will plan ways to increase learning quality and effectiveness. An open discussion is had about what went well, what did not, and what can be done to improve the learning process</p>
        
        <strong>Review </strong>
        <p>At the end of every sprint, we will hold a Mini-Hackathon. The Hackathon will test the skills you learned of the course of the Sprint. Other employees of the organization will review what your team builds in the Hackathon and provide feedback.</p>
